        "description":"Broad Street is situated atop a buried inlet of the East River. When the first Dutch settlers arrived in Lower Manhattan in 1625 they named the inlet Heere Gracht after a canal in Amsterdam. After the English took over the colony, they buried the canal in 1676. On today’s maps, the only physical reminder of the Heere Gracht is Bridge Street, a two-block road that intersects with Broad Street. Prior to 1676, the intersection was a bridge spanning the canal."

Its center and deepest point — 70 feet — was at the present-day intersection of Leonard and Centre streets. The pond occupied 48 acres in an outline that includes present-day Foley Square, Manhattan Criminal Court, the city Department of Health and the Manhattan Supreme Court. At Worth Street, a neck of land jutted into the pond, separating Little Collect from the larger section of the pond."

To this day, construction crews working in Minetta’s path have to be careful not to unearth it when digging. Many basements in the area have a tendency to flood after a particularly heavy rain. The NYU Law School Library fights a constant battle against Minetta’s underground spring. Located at the south‐west corner of Washington Square Park, there is a continuous flow of groundwater into its basement at an estimated rate of 2‐5 gallons per minute in dry weather, which is pumped into a nearby sewer.  Sink holes are also a common occurrence along 12th Street in the area where the two forks of Minetta converge."

One of the first major pathways in colonial New Amsterdam, it was originally named “Maagde Paatje,” Dutch for “Maiden Path”.  The WPA Guide to New York City described it as “a footpath used by lovers along a rippling brook;” while in all probability, lovers certainly did carouse along the creek, the pathway was also called “Maiden Lane” because of the popularity of the nearby brook among mothers and daughters as a place to do the family laundry on sunny days."

        "description":"Tibbetts Brook originates in Yonkers, flows through Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, and disappears into the sewer system at the southern edge of the park. The brook contributes about 2 billion gallons of water to the sewer system annually, significantly reducing the system’s capacity to process storm water during rain events. This leads to the discharge of about 400 million gallons of sewage into to the Harlem River, annually. The sewage is discharged at combined sewer overflow (CSO) point #56. A joint proposal of the NYC Dept. of Environmental Protection (DEP) and Dept. of Parks and Recreation (DPR) is to daylight the brook, meaning bring it back to the surface, and separate it from the sewer system. In addition to improving the water quality of the Harlem River, the project would alleviate flooding due to storms like Hurricane Ida, improve the ecological health of Van Cortlandt Park, and create a greenway for use by cyclists and pedestrians that would connect the upstate rail trails to the greenways of Manhattan. The proposed route would be along an abandoned rail right-of-way, about 60% of which is now owned by CSX rail company. The project enjoys widespread political support and is slated to begin in 2025, but the city must first acquire the CSX property for the project to go forward."

        "description":"Originally a stream draining the uplands of western Long Island, Newtown Creek was dredged, straightened and bulkheaded as the surrounding area was drained, urbanized and industrialized early during the development of New York City. By 1930, the waterbody had been transformed to very near its present configuration, and Newtown Creek was serving as a major industrial waterway through which materials were brought to and from area industries, including major oil refineries and terminals, smelting operations, manufactured gas plants, and other heavy industries. The surrounding area had been fully urbanized and industrialized, with sewage and industrial wastes discharging directly to the Creek without treatment, and the natural marshlands and freshwater streams replaced with combined sewers and storm drains. The urbanization of the surrounding drainage area resulted in an estimated five-fold increase in imperviousness and a two-fold increase in the annual runoff volume to the waterbody. Stripped of the surrounding buffers of marshland and its natural freshwater flow, the waterbody was deprived of any natural response mechanisms that might have helped absorb the increased hydraulic and pollutant loads. The Creek’s limited circulation and exchange with the East River allowed pollutants to build up within the Creek, and water quality deteriorated to such an extent that Newtown Creek was notorious as a polluted waterway. There are currently many efforts underway to remediate the creek, which include expanding the sewage system to reduce the number of combined sewer overflow (CSO) events that continue to pollute the creek."

When looking at the historical landscape of the neighborhoods that ESCR aims to protect from flooding and sea level rise, it becomes instantly obvious why such a program is needed. The entire Lower East Side used to be low-lying marshland. The marshes and streams were drained and filled. East River Park, which experienced bad flooding during Hurricane Sandy and is being elevated 8 feet as part of ESCR, is entirely built on what used to be water."

        "description": "Brook Park was created in 1979 from a series of vacant lots acquired by the city as a part of the South Bronx Neighborhood Open Space Development Project, and today the space houses a vibrant community garden, overseen by the Friends of Brook Park (FoBP). When their own research turned up evidence that the brook had flowed just west of their garden, FoBP developed their own plan in partnership with the Gaia Institute to bring a small portion of the Mill Brook back to life. The Brook Restoration project includes planning a wetland system in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the South Bronx with native plantings to support fauna, similar to the natural brook that ran through the park in the late 1800’s. Rainwater harvesting from adjacent buildings would divert 1,000,000 gallons of water a year from the combined-sewer to an above ground cistern for irrigation, and below-grade cisterns used to maintain water levels in the wetland. A comprehensive ecosystem assessment will be used to determine native plantings and diverse species habitat. Community involvement and stewardship will ensure the success of the project over the long-term. The study was funded through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) South Bronx Waterfront Partnership and managed by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS).  "

The source was a large spring; a Mr. Daniel Tiemann, 73rd Mayor of NYC, had built a color works/dye factory on the site in the mid-19th century, and the water from this spring was used in the factory. In 1909, pasteurization and bottling plant was built on the spring, which was later purchased by Columbia University and renamed Prentis Hall. Predictably, the basement kept flooding. Eventually a tunnel was dug in a basement wall and the water now flows into a channel in the basement and out through a pipe that connects it with a sewer along 125th. Instead of providing drinking water, the spring now feeds the sewer system, taxing the wastewater treatment systems and increasing the chance of combined sewer overflow (CSO) events. "
