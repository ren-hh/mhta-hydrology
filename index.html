     <h3> Zerega Ave Municipal Fleet Electrification Potential</h3>
     <p>In February 2020, Mayor de Blasio committed NYC to achieving an all-electric fleet by 2040. To achieve this, the city will need Con Edison's support in expanding and strenghtening the electrical infrastructure in key locations to effectively and safely serve these new loads.</p>
     <p> Zerega Avenue in the Bronx is home to many of the municipal fleets that will be looking to go electric. The existing electrical infrastructure is not adequate to support the electrification, so significant upgrades will be required.</p>
     <p>Click a marker to see the details of a particular fleet and the estimated additional electric load. The color of the marker represents the type of fleet. </p>
     <p>The squares represent nearby substations. Click the substation to learn the voltage class and estimated remaining capacity for electric demand. </p>
